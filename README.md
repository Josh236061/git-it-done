Rice U Bootcamp Module 6 Project: Git It Done

# module scenario & requirements
In this module, you'll work with Amiko, a fellow web developer whom you met at a local tech meetup. Amiko is eager to contribute to open source projects, but she's found the process of looking for them on GitHub to be time-consuming and tedious. So she's started working on a web app that will search GitHub for open source projects with open issues and pull requests. However, there’s one big blocker: Amiko hasn’t learned JavaScript yet.

And that’s where you come in! Most of the HTML and CSS for this project is already done. You'll add the necessary JavaScript logic to display GitHub repositories and their open issue counts based on a user's search.
